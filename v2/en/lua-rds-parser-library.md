This Lua library can be used to parse the Resty-DBD-Stream formatted data generated by [Drizzle Nginx Module](drizzle-nginx-module/) and [Postgres Nginx Module](postgres-nginx-module/) into Lua data structures. In the past, we have to use JSON as the intermediate data format which is quite inefficient in terms of both memory and CPU time.

To maximize speed and minimize memory footprint, this library is implemented in pure C.

This library is enabled by default; use the `--without-lua_rds_parser` option to disable it when running `./configure` to build [OpenResty](openresty/).
