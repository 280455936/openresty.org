#  Version 1.9.15.1 - 17 May 2016

* upgraded the [Nginx](nginx.html) core to 1.9.15.
    * see the changes here: http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES
* feature: added restydoc documentation indexes for the official [nginx](nginx.html) core and most of the official openresty components.
* upgraded [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/ -nginx-module#readme) to 0.10.5.
    * bugfix: use of [ssl_certificate_by_lua*](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ssl_certificate_by_lua_block) in the `http {}` scope might lead to process crashes. thanks Andreas Lubbe for the report.
    * bugfix: [ngx.print("")](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxprint) did not trigger response header sending.
    * feature: linux x64: now we try limiting the growth of the data segment of the [nginx](nginx.html)
processes to preserve as much lowest address space for LuaJIT as possible. thanks Shuxin Yang for the help.
    * bugfix: [init_worker_by_lua*](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#init_worker_by_lua) did not
honor `http {}` top-level configurations like
[lua_ssl_verify_depth](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_verify_depth)
and [lua_ssl_trusted_certificate](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_trusted_certificate).
thanks Vladimir Shaykovskiy for the report.
    * bugfix: [ngx.exit()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxexit) could not be used in the context
of [balancer_by_lua*](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#balancer_by_lua_block) when
[lua-resty-core](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core#readme) was used.
    * bugfix: `*_by_lua_block`: fixed Lua long bracket parsing at buffer boundaries. thanks Maxim Ivanov and Tom Thorogood for the report.
    * bugfix: [ngx.req.append_body()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxreqappend_body) might enter infinite loops when
[ngx.req.init_body()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxreqinit_body) has not specified a buffer size and the request
header `Content-Length` is 0 (or [client_body_buffer_size](http://nginx.org/r/client_body_buffer_size) is configured to 0).
thanks Hai for the report and Dejiang Zhu for the patch.
    * bugfix: [ngx.re.match](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxrematch): the 5th argument hid the 4th one.
thanks iorichina for the report and rako9000 for the original patch.
    * bugfix: [ngx.worker.id()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxworkerid) should return
`nil` in non-worker processes like nginx's cache managers. thanks Weixie Cui for the patch.
    * bugfix: fixed a memory leak in [cert_pem_to_der()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/ssl.md#cert_pem_to_der), caught by valgrind.
    * bugfix: ignore unexpected closing long-brackets in `*_by_lua_block` directives. thanks Thibault Charbonnier for the patch.
    * bugfix: changing peers in [balancer_by_lua*](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#balancer_by_lua_block)
might lead to stale values of [$upstream_addr](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#var_upstream_addr).
    * bugfix: clear errors in [ngx.ssl](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/ssl.md#readme)
and [ngx.ocsp](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/ocsp.md#readme) functions to avoid flooding [nginx](nginx.html) error logs. thanks Hamish for the original patch.
    * bugfix: [tcpsock:sslhandshake()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#tcpsocksslhandshake)
did not correctly check argument count. thanks Ilya Shipitsin for the report.
    * bugfix: [tcpsock:sslhandshake()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#tcpsocksslhandshake)
accepts up to 5 arguments now (including the object itself).
    * bugfix: assignment to [ngx.status](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxstatus)
might not affect subsequent [ngx.status](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxstatus)
reads when [error_page](http://nginx.org/r/error_page) had already
taken place. thanks wangwei4514 for the report.
    * refactor: refactored the implementation of the [ngx.semaphore](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/semaphore.md#readme) API.
thanks Weixie Cui for the patch.
    * doc: typo fixes from Christos Trochalakis.
* upgraded [lua-resty-core](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core#readme) to 0.1.6.
    * feature: implemented [ngx.worker.id()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxworkerid)
and [ngx.worker.count()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxworkercount)
with [FFI](http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html). thanks Yuansheng Wang for the patch.
    * bugfix: Lua's tail-call optimization might unexpectedly make
[ngx.semaphore](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/semaphore.md#readme) objects
get garbage-collected prematurely even when there're still waiters.
this could happen when [lua_check_client_abort](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_check_client_abort) is enabled. thanks Dejiang Zhu for the patch.
    * doc: [ngx.semaphore](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/semaphore.md#readme): documented the "timeout"
argument of `wait()` in more detail.
    * doc: typo fixes from Alessandro Ghedini.
    * doc: formatting fixes from ms2008.
* upgraded [lua-resty-redis](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-redis#readme) to 0.24.
    * bugfix: added a `tostring()` call to avoid the "attempt to concatenate local 'prefix' (a nil value)" error in Lua function `_read_reply()`.
    * optimize: we now alway call `tostring()` upon args in Redis query methods.
    * optimize: reduced Lua string concatenations in redis query composition.
* upgraded [lua-resty-dns](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-dns#readme) to 0.16.
    * bugfix: when the `AD` and `CD` bits are set in the DNS responses as per RFC 2065, they would erroneously be treated as a part
of the error code (`RCODE`). thanks Celebi Lui for the report and patch.
* upgraded [lua-resty-memcached](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-memcached#readme) to 0.14.
    * optimize: reduced [table.concat()](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-table.concat) calls
while constructing memcached requests, which can lead to fewer Lua string creation operations.
    * bugfix: `get()` did not return server error responses. thanks Lorenz Bauer for the report.
    * bugfix: `gets()` did not return server error responses. thanks Lorenz Bauer for the report.
    * bugfix: `get()`: simplified the error messages so that the caller can check the error more easily.
    * feature: `set_timeout()` now returns the result of the operation. thanks Guanlan Dai for the report.
* upgraded [resty-cli](https://github.com/openresty/resty-cli#readme) to 0.08.
    * feature: `resty`: multiple `-e` options, along with the file argument, are supported.
    * feature: added new command-line utility, restydoc, for viewing OpenResty/Nginx documentation on the terminal (inspired by Perl's `perldoc` utility) via `groff` (used by `man` as well).
    * feature: added new command-line utility, md2pod.pl, for converting GitHub-flavored Markdown source to Perl's POD format.
    * feature: added new command-line utility, restydoc-index, for generating the documentation indexes by scanning Markdown and POD document
files in user-specified directories, which can be used by the restydoc tool.
    * feature: added new command-line utility, nginx-xml2pod, for converting NGINX's official XML-formatted documentation to Perl's POD format.
    * bugfix: `resty`: the `--valgrind` command-line option was broken.
* upgraded [lua-cjson](https://github.com/openresty/lua-cjson#readme) to 2.1.0.4.
    * feature: added the `cjson.as_array` metamethod to enforce empty array encoding. thanks Thibault Charbonnier for the patch.
    * bugfix: fixed the 16 decimal number encoding assertion. thanks Thibault Charbonnier for the patch.
    * doc: added proper documentation for OpenResty's fork of [lua-cjson](https://github.com/openresty/lua-cjson#readme). thanks Thibault Charbonnier for the patch.
