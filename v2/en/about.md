This bundle is mainly maintained by Yichun Zhang ([agentzh](http://agentzh.org)). It was originally sponsored by [Taobao.com](http://www.taobao.com) before the year 2011 and it has been mainly supported by [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com) since then.

Because most of the [Nginx](nginx/) modules are developed by the bundle maintainers, it can be ensured
that all these modules are played well together.
